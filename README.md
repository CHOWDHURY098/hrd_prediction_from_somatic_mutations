# HRD Prediction from Somatic Mutations
Machine learning framework to predict homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) from tumor mutation and copy-number patterns.

# Overview
Homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is a major genomic instability phenotype in cancer and is clinically relevant for PARP inhibitor response. 
Traditional HRD scoring relies on predefined genomic scars such as LOH, LST, and TAI.

This project implements a computational approach that learns HRD status directly from somatic mutation and copy-number patterns using machine learning.

The pipeline converts real cancer cohort data into model-ready features and produces biologically interpretable predictions.
